In this form a reference to your Adviser means the Nominated Financial Adviser on your account. By completing this form:\n\n- You can provide or renew consent to an ongoing fee arrangement under which your Adviser will arrange the deduction of ongoing fees from your account; and\n- You authorise and direct Netwealth to pay the ongoing member advice fees set out in this form to the AFS Licensee for whom your Adviser acts as an authorised representative (whoever that may be from time to time) and you consent to some or all of this amount being paid by the AFS Licensee to your Adviser (or their nominee).\n\nAn ongoing fee arrangement is a fee arrangement that is intended to continue to apply for more than 12 months. These fees are for services provided to you by your Adviser. Your Adviser is required to obtain your written consent before the ongoing fees can be deducted from your account. This form can be used to provide that consent. If you are not happy with the amount described, you do not have to sign this form, in which case the fees will not be paid to your Adviser. You may vary or withdraw your consent at any time by contacting your Adviser in writing or notifying Netwealth. An ongoing fee arrangement is subject to annual renewal. Member advice fees can only be paid from your superannuation account for services provided to you by your Adviser specifically in relation to your superannuation account. A separate consent form must be provided for each account. A Netwealth may be entitled to receive a Reduced Input Tax Credit (RITC) on these fees and the amount deducted from your account to pay these fees may be less than the amount shown on this form. A You should read the current Product Disclosure Statement for the product in which your account is held as there may have been changes to the terms and conditions governing this transaction.
